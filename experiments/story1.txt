"Roland!" I call. "Wait up!"
He is far ahead of me, weaving through a crowd.
"Don't let me lose him." I think aloud.
"Roland!" I call again. 
I have lost him completely.
"No! Great." I groan as people continue to move around me.
I make it to another platform and lean on the guardrail.
I look down at the track below, sighing.
My train is gone and I have no way to buy another ticket.
On top of that, I've lost the only person I know.
Am I going to get home?
If so, how?
