She is far ahead of me, ramming into people like she is.
"How did it ever come to this?" I think aloud.
"Krystal!" I call again. 
She is gone.
"We have to go together! Krystal..." I shout into the air as people continue to move around me.
I arrive at a metal bench and throw myself on it, sobbing.
My train is gone and I have no way to buy another ticket.
On top of that, I just lost Krystal.
I'm never going to make it to Enchante?
